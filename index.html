                <p class="font-italic text-muted"><b>Archaeology is a messy business.</b> Digging holes—in the dirt, in the sand, and in the rain forest—is essential. Now there’s a new way to search, with no shovels needed. Some 400 miles up in space, satellites collect images that are used to identify buried landscapes with astonishing precision. Like medical scans that let doctors examine parts of the body they couldn’t otherwise see, satellite images help scientists find and map long-lost rivers, roads, and cities, and discern archaeological features in conflict zones too dangerous to visit. “There is much we miss on the ground,” emphasizes University of Alabama at Birmingham archaeologist Sarah Parcak, a pioneer in using satellite imagery in Egypt. “We’ve only discovered a fraction of one percent of archaeological sites all over the world.”</p>
                <p class="font-italic text-muted">To examine the broad subject areas of geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and landscape archaeology, we first need to define these separate yet interconnected terms. Are remote sensing and GIS a formal part of landscape archaeology? Are GIS and remote sensing the same thing, or are they completely different subfields? Does remote sensing cover both satellite remote sensing and ground-based remote sensing? With new advances in satellite and remote sensing technologies, as well as advances in computing, these fields seem to redefine themselves daily based on what is currently possible and will be possible. Practitioners of these fields and their related subfields cannot specialize in all areas: they must have both technical expertise and field-specific specializations. So, how can students familiarize themselves with all the appropriate technical tools they need, and how can archaeologists become more aware of all the tools and technologies at their fingertips to do better fieldwork? A vast array of opportunities exists, but the cost and time needed to learn these new technologies are deterrents, especially to those archaeologists working in countries with little to no fieldwork funding. A single chapter is not enough to cover even one of these three areas, but many books define their histories and general applications (Parcak 2009; Wiseman and El Baz 2007). Instead, this chapter summarizes the current state of play in landscape archaeology, making clear a number of current practices within GIS and remote sensing, including new and exciting developments with light detection and ranging (LiDAR). It is not possible to cover the hundreds of archaeologist projects using these new tools in innovative ways. Instead, this chapter highlights pertinent case study approaches primarily from the past 5 years to suggest best practices for future uses.</p>
                <p class="font-italic text-muted">What, then, does the future hold for approaches in landscape archaeology? In the Middle East, looting and site destruction are rampant. In Egypt alone, if looting continues at its current rate, all sites will be affected by looting and damage by 2040 (Parcak et al. 2016). Other countries likely have similar challenges. It is interesting to note that this projected 2040 figure matches the known “tipping point” for global environmental destruction as well. Archaeologists have a primary responsibility to protect and preserve our shared heritage for future generations, but they cannot do it without using state-of-the-art technologies in an equally responsible way. Using iPads, iPhones, and Android devices, it is now easier than ever to record data as it is being uncovered in the field for ongoing analyses as well as for sharing with colleagues. Real-time survey will have much to offer the field versus standard paper recording because archaeologists can examine processed data while working. For example, I processed WorldView-2 multispectral satellite imagery in a landscape of northern Iceland in order to discover possible medieval and Norse structures buried in fields. Initial efforts located possible buried structures, but, without the benefit of previous fieldwork and knowledge of the local landscapes, it seemed the structures were missed. Once I visited the landscapes in question, I reprocessed the data with the assistance of the survey team, and they helped me to interpret the data. Subsequent coring revealed multiple ephemeral Norse structures. Without prior landscape knowledge, it is likely that many features would have been missed.</p>
